# Alcoholless: lightweight security sandbox for Homebrew

Alcoholless Homebrew (`alcless brew`) executes Homebrew in a separate environment
so as to reduce concerns around potential supply chain attacks.

```bash
cd ~/SOME_DIRECTORY
alcless brew install xz
alcless xz SOME_FILE
```

In the example above, `xz` works as a separate user with an access for the copy of the current directory.
Changed files are synced back to the current directory when the command exits.

Other directories are inaccessible, as long as the permissions are set correctly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Alcoholless uses an [unsupported installation mode](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#untar-anywhere-unsupported) of Homebrew
> that uses a custom installation prefix.
>
> **Do NOT report any issue that happens with Alcoholless to the upstream Homebrew.**

Alcoholless can be used for running non-Homebrew commands too.

## Install

Requirements:
- macOS
- [Go](https://go.dev)

To install Alcoholless, run:

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

Makefile variables:
- `PREFIX`: installation prefix (default: `/usr/local`)

## Usage

To initialize the "default" sandbox (user account `alcless_${USER}_default`):
```
alclessctl create default
```

### Group mode

By default, tag sandbox user accounts with the prefix `alcless_${USER}_`.
When ALCLESS_GROUP environment variable is set, uses the group membership to tag them.

This mode supports user accounts set up outside of alcless. Set the `ALCLESS_GROUP` environment variable to enable group mode:

```bash
export ALCLESS_GROUP=mygroup
alclessctl create myuser
```

When `ALCLESS_GROUP` is set:
- The instance name is used directly as the username (e.g., `myuser` instead of `alcless_${USER}_myuser`)
- Discovery of instances is done via group membership

To run a command:
```
alclessctl shell default -- brew install xz
```
or
```
alcless brew install xz
```

To run a command, without rsyncing the current directory:
```
alclessctl shell --plain default bash
```
or
```
alcless --plain bash
```

To remove the sandbox:
```
alclessctl delete default
```

The command line is designed to be similar to [`limactl`](https://lima-vm.io/docs/usage/).

## How it works
Just plain old utilities under the hood: `sudo`, `su`, `pam_launchd`, and `rsync`.

A future version may also incorporate [FSKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fskit/) to replace `rsync`.

### Security notice
Alcoholless creates `/etc/sudoers.d/alcless_exampleuser_default` for the user `exampleuser`, with the following content:
```
exampleuser ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/su - alcless_exampleuser_default -c *
```

This `sudo` configuration allows `exampleuser` to run `/usr/bin/su - alcless_exampleuser_default -c *` as the `root` user,
without the password.

The `su` command being executed through `sudo` can run an arbitrary command as the sandbox user `alcless_exampleuser_default`.

See [FAQs](#faqs) for the reason why `su` is wrapped inside `sudo`.

## Advanced information

### FAQs
#### Why wrap `su` inside `sudo`?
Because `sudo` doesn't isolate "a specific Mach bootstrap subset, audit session and other characteristics not recognized by POSIX" (see `launchd(8)`),
while `su` isolates them.

e.g., `sudo -u alcless_exampleuser_default open -a TextEdit` opens the `TextEdit` application as the current user, not as `alcless_exampleuser_default`.

This issue could be solved by copying the `pam_launchd.so` configuration from `/etc/pam.d/su` to `/etc/pam.d/sudo`,
however, touching such system configuration files might be scary.

So, the current workaround is to just wrap `sudo` inside `su`.

#### Why not use VM?
Because Apple's [Virtualization.framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization)
apparently does not provide a way to automate the initialization steps of macOS (e.g., accept EULA, skip enabling iCloud, set up SSH).

Also, Virtualization.framework does not support accessing the host GPUs yet.

#### Why not support Linux and FreeBSD?
Because Linux and FreeBSD already have containers.

#### How does Alcoholless relate to Lima?
- Alcoholless: run Homebrew in a separate user (not a VM, nor a container)
- [Lima](https://lima-vm.io/): run a Linux VM, particularly for running containers

The `alclessctl` CLI is designed to mimic the `limactl` CLI for an easier learning,
however, Alcoholless does not use Lima under the hood currently.

Eventually, Alcoholless may incorporate Lima for stronger isolation using VMs,
when we can figure out how to automate the initialiation steps of macOS VMs (See ["Why not use VM?"](#why-not-use-vm)).
